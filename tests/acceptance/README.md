Acceptance tests go here. You can start with:

```ruby
require 'test_helper'

class SomeControllerTest < Minitest::Test
  # These lines of code should not be edited. They add necessary
  # functionality for running our "acceptance tests".
  def app
    MyApp
  end

  # The actual tests go below this comment.

  def setup
    super
    
    # Your setup goes here.
  end

  # Your tests are defined here.
end
```
